Portfolio â€” Your Name

This is a minimal static portfolio template. Open `index.html` in a browser to preview.

Features
- Responsive layout (hero, about, projects, contact)
- Dark-mode toggle persisted to `localStorage`
- Mobile nav toggle and smooth scrolling
- Contact form stub (no backend)

Local preview

Run using a static file server. Examples:

Python 3 (built-in):

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

Node (serve):

```bash
npx serve .
```

Then open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.

Customizing
- Replace "Your Name", bio, projects, and links in `index.html`.
- Update colors and layout in `styles.css`.

Next steps
- Hook the contact form up to a serverless function or email service (Formspree, Netlify Forms, etc.)
- Replace placeholder project images with real screenshots
